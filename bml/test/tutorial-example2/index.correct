	<h1>Hansel and Grendel Go to Finishing School</h1>

	<p>Our story begins at a point in the Universe not unlike where you are now
	  sitting, drinking your government-sanctioned stimulant, dreaming of the
	  day when you, too, will own your own personalized luxury home on 0.3 acres
	  of land, with a stunning view of, well, the neighbor's personalized luxury
	  home on 0.3 acres of land. Except this point in the Universe is much more
	  exciting, fine-smelling, and generally a better place to be than
	  yours.</p>

	<h2>No, Really, It Is Much Finer</h2>

	<p>So, anyway, at this particular point in the Universe, on a day not
	  entirely unlike today, two entirely unrelated mythological pantheons
	  collided, resulting in a fast friendship between a Little Boy Bound to be
	  Eaten by the Architypal Crone and a Faceless Beast That Waits for the Hero
	  to Dispatch It. Which, as you might have guessed, was not the intention of
	  the various storytellers involved, but that's what happens when people
	  stop reading all the really cool stories and start checking the Financial
	  Section every 12 minutes. There's only so much space to go around in the
	  collective consciousness, you know...</p>
