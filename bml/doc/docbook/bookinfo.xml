      Anyone's who's ever put together a large website or done a lot of server-side 
      programming will know how hard and annoying it is to keep a consistent look 
      through a site, and how painful it is to go back and change something globally 
      later, once their site is up. In addition, looking at <abbrev>HTML</abbrev>
      code is ugly and <abbrev>HTML</abbrev> editors don't always do what you want them to.

    <para>
      <abbrev>BML</abbrev> was designed to address a lot of these problems. 
      <abbrev>BML</abbrev> is a server-side markup language that lets you define your own 
      <abbrev>BML</abbrev> blocks and use them as templates within your <abbrev>BML</abbrev> pages. 
      Your templates don't even have to be static. Because <abbrev>BML</abbrev> pages are 
      converted to <abbrev>HTML</abbrev> on the server when users request them, this also 
      enables you to embed live code within your <abbrev>BML</abbrev> pages, just like a 
      <abbrev>CGI</abbrev> script.        
    </para>
    <para>
      A lot is possible using <abbrev>BML</abbrev>. Whether you want to make a full blown
      database driven website, enable a little dynamic content on your site, or just
      make things on your site easier to maintain, <abbrev>BML</abbrev> can really help out.
