/support/encodings.bml.edit.header=I cannot edit my entries in the web interface!

/support/encodings.bml.edit.text<<
<?p <b>Short answer:</b> <i>(applicable if you write your journal in English)</i>: Go to your 
<a href="/editinfo.bml">personal settings page</a>. Find an option
neat the bottom of the page that is called <b>Auto-convert older entries from:</b>. Choose
"Western European (Windows)" from the pull-down menu and save your settings. Your entries should
now be editable. p?>

<?p <b>Long answer</b>: In order to allow you to edit a non-Unicode entry, LiveJournal code needs to 
know which encoding that entry has been posted in. For users of English and other West European 
languages, this will normally be "Western European (Windows)", although if that doesn't work well
for quote characters and other similar meta-characters, try "Western European (ISO)". Users
writing in other languages should select their encoding; if it isn't in the supplied list, 
contact <a href="/support/">Support</a> and explain the problem.  p?>

<?p Note that "non-Unicode entry" may mean either a journal entry posted before LiveJournal underwent
the conversion to Unicode, or a new journal entry posted recently with a client program that 
is not Unicode-compatible.  p?>
.

/support/encodings.bml.editcl.header=I cannot edit my entries in the client program!

/support/encodings.bml.editcl.text<<
<?p If there is a newer version of your client program that supports Unicode,
upgrade. If not, you will be able to edit entries which contain ASCII symbols only (basically
the Latin alphabet and the usual punctuation signs). For entries any fancy symbols or other 
languages you will have to resort to editing via the web interface, which works fine in any case. p?>
.

/support/encodings.bml.groups.header=I cannot edit my friend lists with my client program!

/support/encodings.bml.groups.text<<
<?p This is probably due to you having friend groups with names that aren't exclusively ASCII (for
example, written in non-Latin languages or containing accent symbols). In order to successfully
work with such group names, you have to use a Unicode-supporting client. Alternatively, you
can rename your groups to ASCII-only names on the 
<a href="/friends/editgroups.bml">group editing page</a> and then use your client program. p?>
.

/support/encodings.bml.overview.header=What is this all about?

/support/encodings.bml.overview.text<<
<?p LiveJournal uses Unicode to store and display everything: 
text of journal entries, comments, names and personal information... everything. 
Unicode is a very powerful standard for working with text. 
For example, it allows users to store and input information in many languages at once. 
It supports the infrastructure of translating and maintaining the user interface in 
languages other than English. p?>

<?p Journal entries and comments which had been stored before LiveJournal switched
to Unicode need to be converted to Unicode on-the-fly in order for the user to be able 
to view or edit them. This page explains how to deal with some of the common problems in
that area. p?>
