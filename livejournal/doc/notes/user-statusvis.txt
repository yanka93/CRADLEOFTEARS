"statusvis" stands for "status visibility" and is the basic way that
accounts are marked with various statuses.  This column in the user table
is a single character and is taken from the list below:


V - visible
This is the normal status that applies to most accounts.  Nothing special.

S - suspended
Accounts that are suspended are effectively invisible.  Normal people
cannot see the contents of suspended journals.  People with the 'canview'
privilege have some access to see these accounts.  (See information on that
privilege.)

D - deleted
When someone deletes their own account.  Has much the same effects as being
suspended, except the user is allowed to undelete their account.

X - expunged
After an account has been deleted for a while it is expunged.  This process
removes all data for an account.  At this point the account can no longer
be undeleted.

R - renamed
When a user is renamed a row is created in the user table with their OLD
username and a statusvis of R.  This means that any requests for this user
need to be mapped to the username they renamed to.

M - memorial
No changes from a normal account except that memorial accounts cannot have
new posts added to them.

L - locked
Accounts in this status are frozen.  They cannot be logged in to, cannot
receive comments or post comments, cannot post entries, cannot edit
entries, and basically can't do anything on the site with this account.
