    (Don't try to make much sense of this list.  It's mainly for the
     core developers to keep track of things.)

DOCUMENTATION: (JPROULX)

-- how to modify site-local text (like: en_LJ from en) (done?)

-- document all the db roles, and how to set 'em up in %LJ::DBINFO. (done?)

ANYBODY:

-- Windows syncitem client.  Use Perl+Win::Forms+ActiveState compiler
   ... make local GDBM/etc file.  Export to HTML/XML/etc from that
   file.

-- user journal stats (have most of plan)

-- ESN system (Event/Subscription/Notification) (have plan/API)

* need a 'replyanywhere' priv that lets site admins reply in journals
  that are friends only, when the site admins aren't part of the
  community.

* fix LJ::get_itemid_{before|after} to respect security of $remote
   NOTE: not easy to do fast.  maybe best not to do it. not a big deal.

* version checking in login protocol mode:
   -- each client string:  versionid|version|security|noteline
   -- new protocol login req opt: "checklevel" = { all | none | securityonly }
   -- priv for client authors to update db

misc:
developers/doc link wrong
topics / named entries (url space control)
logaccess bypass
talkleft_xfp investigation

* clustering:
   -- console
   -- after user's moved, update their memories:
                 (0,global)->(userid,ditemid)
      that way, filtering on "my own" will work.

* rate limiting

MISC:

* new authentication/login system...
   -- SSL logins & login tokens
   -- for non-SSL clients:  challenge/response (with challenge
      being request body, plus GMT yyyymmddhh)
* ljcom: automate username changes (payments and renaming)
* BML::500_on_die option: make BML send a 500 server error on any
  _CODE block failure
* BML: let VarInitScript define a hook to run on server error to
  get error message, look at it, and decide new error message.
* Syndicating channels:
     http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?itemid=14311193
* /fz/ joins on logtext (requires master) 
* talk* joins on logtext (requires master)
* cvsreport:
   * -c doesn't need to scan maind.. perf.
   * -s with args doesn't need to scan everything, just args.
* support: dakus wants to be able to mark requests as "still needs help"
* LJ::delete_user()
* require POST for all do actions (use LJ::did_post to check)
* perf: don't preload friends in ljprotocol.pl:editfriends, check $sth->rows
* comprehensive fix for adding communities as friends: befriending vs.
  watching: provide a way for users to turn bit 0 off in allowmask,
  essentially.

+-------------+
| Cleanliness |
+-------------+

* should never need to login as community!
  -- e.g. uploadpic/editinfo/etc needs to let community admins 
          select their community to modify while logged in as
          themselves
  -- start using auth_info_2 everywhere like editpics/uploadpic
* use LJ::send_mail everywhere, not sendmail pipe by hand
* XHTML compliant everywhere
* remove *_do.bml pages, merge into one page instead.

+--------+
| Future |
+--------+

* HTML email we send out with images should be the images in the MIME body
  and then HTML part reference those, not the ones on the site
* attach files to posts (good for groupware)
  -- new cap limits:  canattachfile, filemaxsize (0 for no limit)
* support system tweaks:
   - ugly green to blue
   - allow touching by helpers
   - allow 5 minute locks
   - allow full email address to be shown to helpers
* use <label> and accesskey= everywhere, for accessibility and
  people that hate the mouse.
* ability to further resrict HTML in comments in your journal:
  no marquee, no img, etc.
* respect user.status=="L" --> never let be modified, deleted, purged, etc
* journal-wide security: private, friends/group only, by password

+--------------+
| low priority |
+--------------+

* ability to turn off display of friend ofs / friends / community ofs
* remove necessity of menu_num arg in populate_web_menu 
* allowing @livejournal.com on create_do.bml, but not editinfo_do.bml
* on friends page, altposter posts show community mood theme, not owner's
* remove directories in BML... make just generic.look -> scheme.look

+-----------------+
| Meeting minutes |
+-----------------+
* new BML release? get bmlp.pl from livejournal, not bradfitz.com/bml
* directory rewrite sometime
* INERR undefined in livejournal?  no, it was.  weird.
* goatctl: toggle/reset goathack dev environment (idigital)
* two CVS: use collections (avva)
* list server ... get working, announce, use.
  * peer review of patches before mailing brad
* talkread/post library & abstraction for todo lists
* todo list maintainership (Mart)
* new install tarball -- upgrading -- yech:
  -- need translation stuff done; move text/code apart
* store as UTF-8 in database (avva investigating)
* community "member of" friend adding problem
* poll creator needs to be linked
* /press/* history.bml, qa.bml (opiummmm)
* rate limiting
* talkread screening (avva)
* image serving / expiration (evan)
