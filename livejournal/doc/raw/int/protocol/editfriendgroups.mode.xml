&authInfo;

<key name="groupmasks" count="opt"><struct count="1">
<des>
A structure of friend userids. The values of each are a string representing an unsigned 32-bit integer with bit 0 set (or the server will force it on anyway), bits 1-30 set for each group the friend belongs to, and bit 31 unset (reserved for future use).
</des>
</struct></key>

<key name="set" count="opt"><struct count="1">
<des>
Given the bit of a friend group, the value contains a structure of information on it.
</des>
<struct count="0more">
  <key name="name" count="1"><scalar><des>
      Create or rename the friend group by sending this key. The value is the name of the group.
  </des></scalar></key>
  <key name="sort" count="opt"><scalar><des>
      This field should be sent to indicate the sorting order of this group. The value must be in the range of 0-255. The default is 50.
  </des></scalar></key>
  <key name="public" count="opt"><scalar><des>
      If this is "1", then this group is marked as public. If public, other users can see the name of the group and the people that are in it.
  </des></scalar></key>
</struct>
</struct></key>

<key name="delete" count="opt"><list count="1"><scalar count="0more"><des>
A number of a friend group to delete (which can be from 1-30, inclusive). The server will modify all old entries that allow access to that friend group, so a new friend group using that number won't have access to old non-related entries. However, it is the client's responsibility to modify each friend's groupmask to remove them from the group as it's deleted.
