<method name="postevent">
<shortdes>
The most important mode, this is how a user actually submits a new log entry to the server.
</shortdes>
<des>
Given all of the require information on a post, optioanlly adding security or meta data, will create a new entry. Will return the itemid of the new post.
</des>
<arguments><struct count="1">

&authInfo;

<key name="event" count="1"><scalar><des>
The event/log text the user is submitting. Carriage returns are okay (0x0A, 0x0A0D, or 0x0D0A), although 0x0D are removed internally to make everything into Unix-style line-endings (just \ns). Posts may also contain HTML, but be aware that the LiveJournal server converts newlines to HTML &lt;BR&gt;s when displaying them, so your client should not try to insert these itself.
</des></scalar></key>

<key name="lineendings" count="1"><scalar><des>
Specifies the type of line-endings you're using. Possible values are <emphasis>unix</emphasis> (0x0A (\n)), <emphasis>pc</emphasis> (0x0D0A (\r\n)), or <emphasis>mac</emphasis> (0x0D (\r) ). The default is not-Mac. Internally, LiveJournal stores all text as Unix-formatted text, and it does the conversion by removing all \r characters. If you're sending a multi-line event on Mac, you have to be sure and send a lineendings value of mac  or your line endings will be removed. PC and Unix clients can ignore this setting, or you can send it. It may be used for something more in the future.
</des></scalar></key>

<key name="subject" count="1"><scalar><des>
The subject for this post. Limited to 255 characters. No newlines.
</des></scalar></key>

<key name="security" count="opt"><scalar><des>
Specifies who can read this post. Valid values are <emphasis>public</emphasis> (default), <emphasis>private</emphasis> and <emphasis>usemask</emphasis>. When value is usemask, viewability is controlled by the allowmask.
</des></scalar></key>

<key name="allowmask" count="opt"><scalar><des>
Relevant when security is usemask. A 32-bit unsigned integer representing which of the user's groups of friends are allowed to view this post. Turn bit 0 on to allow any defined friend to read it. Otherwise, turn bit 1-30 on for every friend group that should be allowed to read it. Bit 31 is reserved.
</des></scalar></key>

<key name="year" count="1"><scalar><des>
The current 4-digit year (from the user's local timezone).
</des></scalar></key>

<key name="mon" count="1"><scalar><des>
The current 1- or 2-digit month (from the user's local timezone).
</des></scalar></key>

<key name="day" count="1"><scalar><des>
The current 1- or 2-digit day of the month (from the user's local timezone).
</des></scalar></key>

<key name="hour" count="1"><scalar><des>
The current 1- or 2-digit hour from 0 to 23 (from the user's local timezone).
</des></scalar></key>

<key name="min" count="1"><scalar><des>
The current 1- or 2-digit minute (from the user's local timezone).
</des></scalar></key>

<key name="props" count="1"><des>
Set an arbitrary (but restricted) meta-data property to this log item. See the document on properties for the discussion of them and the list of valid names. You may send zero or more keys like this, one for each property you're setting.
</des>
</key>

<key name="usejournal" count="opt">
<des>
If posting to a shared journal, include this key and the username you wish to post to. By default, you post to the journal of "user" as specified above.
</des>
&useJournal;

<!--===================[ RETURN ]==============================-->
<returns><struct count="1">

<key name="itemid" count="1"><scalar><des>
The unique number the server assigned to this post. Currently nothing else in the protocol requires the use of this number so it's pretty much useless, but somebody requested it be returned, so it is.
