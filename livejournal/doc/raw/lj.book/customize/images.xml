    <para>
      LiveJournal uses a standard set of icons for specific pages that are distributed through the <filename role="dir">/img</filename> directory, and handles the configuration for these images in the file: <filename>cgi-bin/imageconf.pl</filename>.
      Each image is configured as an associative array in perl, setup with attributes for each file.
      (FIXME - this needs a lot of work.)
    </para>
  <para>
    <literal>cgi-bin/imageconf.pl</literal> is provided.  Don't
    change that.  But go ahead and add a new file,
    <literal>imageconf-local.txt</literal> beside it in the same
    format, which <literal>imageconf.pl</literal> will find and use.
