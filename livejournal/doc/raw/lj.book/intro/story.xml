  <title>The Story Behind LiveJournal</title>
  <para>
    LiveJournal.com, a website and online community built around
    personal journals, was created by Brad Fitzpatrick in March of
    1999 for himself and some of his friends.  Friends told friends
    and it became a huge success, soon growing bigger than a single
    person could easily handle.

    As a result, a team of volunteers working with LiveJournal's
    creator have transformed LiveJournal into a Webby Award winning
    site used by over one million people worldwide. The site is now an
    open-source software development project funded entirely by its
    members, assisted by numerous volunteers and developers, and
    overseen by a small paid staff. It's been expanded to allow easy
    creation of journals, weblogs, and even interest-based online
    communities.
