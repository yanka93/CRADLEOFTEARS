  <title>MySQL</title>
  <abstract><para>
    There are a few simple reasons why we chose MySQL when picking a database backend for LiveJournal:
    It's <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/information/benchmarks-old.html">fast</ulink>,
    <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Using_the_MySQL_software_for_free_under_GPL.html">free</ulink>,
    <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Stability.html">stable</ulink>,
    <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Privilege_system.html">secure</ulink>, and well supported
    by a large community of users. In this chapter we'll deal with installing and setting up MySQL on
    your server, then we'll show you how to populate your installation with the required base data.

    <title>Install MySQL</title>
    <para>
      LiveJournal requires a MySQL install of at least version 3.23.x,
      but highly recommends installing the latest stable release that is
      available, expecially if you're going to need clustering and
      replication abilities.

    <para>
      MySQL offers binaries for many operating aystems, including Win32
      and several different <quote>flavors</quote> of Unix.
      Installations on any of these systems should be fairly easy, as
      most offer a simple installation program that guides you through
      setup.

  <section id="lj.install.mysql_setup.create_db">
    <title>Create the LiveJournal Database</title>
    <para>
      Login to MySQL as the root MySQL user and create the database that
      will hold the LiveJournal data:
    </para>

<screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>mysql -uroot -p</userinput>
<prompt>mysql></prompt> <userinput>CREATE DATABASE livejournal;</userinput>
<prompt>mysql></prompt> <userinput>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON livejournal.* TO </userinput>
<prompt>     ></prompt> <userinput>lj@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ljpass';</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      If you know what you're doing, you can set this up however you
      like.  You tell LiveJournal how to connect to its database server(s) 
      in your <filename>ljconfig.pl</filename>, as
      detailed in: <xref linkend="lj.install.ljconfig.dbinfo" />.
    </para>

  <section id="lj.install.mysql_setup.pop_db">
    <title>Populate the Database</title>
    <para>
      In order to use your site, you're going to need to populate your MySQL
      database with the required information to get the service started.
    </para>

<screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>cd <envar><link linkend='lj.install.ljhome'>$LJHOME</link></envar></userinput>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>bin/upgrading/update-db.pl --runsql --populate</userinput>
<prompt>$</prompt> <userinput>bin/upgrading/texttool.pl load</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      That'll bring your database schema up-to-date and populate it with any
      look-up data it needs.
