      <abbrev>BML</abbrev> is a server-side markup language that lets you define your own 
      <abbrev>BML</abbrev> blocks and use them as templates within your <abbrev>BML</abbrev> pages. 
      Your templates don't even have to be static. Because <abbrev>BML</abbrev> pages are 
      converted to <abbrev>HTML</abbrev> on the server when users request them, this also 
      enables you to embed live code within your <abbrev>BML</abbrev> pages, just like a 
      <abbrev>CGI</abbrev> script.
