      Currently there are a few types of interfaces available to the LiveJournal
      protocol: the older "flat" interface, the custom XML-RPC interface, and a modified version of the Blogger API.
      The XMLRPC interface is probably easiest to use, because there are quite a few XML-RPC
      resources available to developers in just about any programming language. If
      you're in a situation that requires you to write your own interface wrapper,
      then the flat interface is probably best to use.

        Internally, all interfaces are just wrappers around the same functions.  Don't
        worry too much about which one you use, as they accomplish the same thing.
