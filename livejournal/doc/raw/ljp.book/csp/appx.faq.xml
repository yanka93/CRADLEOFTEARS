      <question><simpara>How do I calculate the protocol itemid to get the <quote>URL</quote> itemid?</simpara></question>
      <answer><simpara>For protocol methods that return an <varname>itemid</varname>, there is also another variable returned called <varname>anum</varname>.
        To calculate the public URL itemid, use the following formula: <inlineequation>(itemid * 256) + anum</inlineequation>.

      <question><simpara>I just wrote a client for LiveJournal.  How do I go about getting it on the Download page?</simpara></question>
      <answer>
        <simpara>The Downloads page currently requires manual updates, which happen infrequently.
          Due to the large userbase which uses clients offered up via the Downloads page, we
          prefer to only add well-established clients to the page at this point.
        </simpara>
        <simpara>
          All too often, someone will code a client and then abandon it after a certain amount of time.
          If you feel that you are willing and able to commit to maintaining and providing support for
          a client, then by all means produce one and announce it on
          <ulink url="http://www.livejournal.com/community/lj_clients/info">lj_clients</ulink>.  It is
          recommended that you create a community for the users of your client, so you can announce new
          versions and provide a forum for troubleshooting and user support.  Once your client has
          matured, it will likely be included on the Downloads page.  If your program has reached a
          point where you feel it should be included in the page and it hasn't been yet, feel free to
          drop a post to <ulink url="http://www.livejournal.com/community/lj_clients/info">lj_clients</ulink>
          asking why.

          <title>Client Listing Guidelines for the <ulink url="http://www.livejournal.com/download/">Download a Client</ulink> page</title>
          <listitem><simpara>As a minimum, clients MUST support the basic features of LiveJournal,
              such as logging in, posting new entries, editing old entries, history views, etc.</simpara></listitem>
          <listitem><simpara>Client MUST be mature and well-established before being listed. Having minor bugs is ok, but
              we don't want to link to clients that have the potential to mess up an account.</simpara></listitem>
          <listitem><simpara>Client MUST be free to use. You're welcome to create and maintain a
              client that isn't free/open, we just don't want to provide free advertising for such a client.</simpara></listitem>
          <listitem><simpara>Client MUST be originally written for LiveJournal. We support the Blogger and Atom APIs, and
              we encourage interoperational clients, but we don't want to get in the habit of listing clients for
              competitor services.</simpara></listitem>

      <question><simpara>Why doesn't my client show up on my user info page?</simpara></question>
      <answer><simpara>Recently client logging was disabled because its current implementation was consuming
        far too many database resources.  It will likely reappear in the future, once a more efficient design
        is coded and tested.
