    <para>
      Styles are the part of LiveJournal that allows users to customize the look
      of their accounts.
    </para>
    <para>
      Currently there are two types of style interfaces available to use,
      the older <quote>S1</quote> which is very linear and dumb, and the newer
      <quote>S2</quote> which features its own sort of programming language.
      Read on for more information on S1, or visit <ulink url="/doc/s2/">The S2
      Manual</ulink> for more information on S2.
