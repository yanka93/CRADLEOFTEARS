  <title>Capabilities Classes</title>
  <para>
    The 'caps' column in the 'user' table is a 16 bit mask with a bit on for each capability class the user is a part of.  Each site can define their own capability classes in <filename>cgi-bin/ljconfig.pl</filename>.  Then, each capability class can define its own limits for the following things.  The <function>LJ::get_cap()</function> and <function>LJ::get_cap_min()</function> functions will consider the limits of all the classes the member is a part of and return the max or min limit, depending on what it's being used for in the code.
  </para>
  <remark>This text should reflect a different view, as the developer is writing the cap _for_ the administrator.</remark>
