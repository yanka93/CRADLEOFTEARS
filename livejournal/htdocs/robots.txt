# Blocked journals aren't listed here because robots.txt files
# can't be above 50k or so, depending on the spider.
# 
# Instead, blocked journals have HTML inserted in them which
# should prevent behaved spiders from indexing it.
#
# Note that http://username.livejournal.com journals have an
# autogenerated robots.txt, since it can be small.
