Version 0.9.1 - 12 Oct 2003
	-- Altered the SockIO helper class, so it no longer allows accessing
		the streams it contains directly, instead it has methods
		with identical signatures to the methods that were called
		on the streams... This makes the client code prettier.
	-- Changed looped non blocking read to blocking read, for getting
		items from the server. This probably reduces CPU usage in
		cases where the retrieval would block, and cleans up the
		code a bit.  We're blocking on retrieval anyhow.
	-- Made get() not call get_multi(), and added single socket
		optimization. This parallels recent changes to the perl
		client
	-- Changed a few for loops to use iterators instead, since it's
		probably marginally more efficient, and it's probably
		better coding practice.
	-- Actually spell checked. :)

Version 0.9.0 - 29 Sep 2003
	-- Renumbered to reflect that it's not been realworld tested
	-- changed package to danga.com.MemCached (thanks)
	-- added dates to changelog
	-- added .txt to text files
	-- added to official memcached site :)

Version 1.0.0 - 28 Sep 2003
	-- Adjusted namespacing for SockIO, it shouldn't have been public; is now package level.
		As a bonus, this means I don't have to Javadoc it. :)
	-- Finished adding complete Javadoc to MemCachedClient.
	-- spellchecked
	-- added a couple versions of function variations that I missed. for example, some that
		didn't take an int directly as a hash value, and i missed a get_multi w/out hashes.
	-- removed java.net.Socket reference from MemCachedClient, SockIO has a new constructor which
		takes hostname and port number
	-- switched to three part version number



Version 0.3 - 27 Sep 2003
	-- Compression, for strings/stringified numbers, this is compatible w/ perl
		Serialized objects are incompatible w/ perl for obvious reasons. :)
	-- Added PORTABILITY file, to include information about using the client
		with various JVM's
	-- Updated string parsing to StreamTokenizer rather than regexp's in an 
		effort to get sablevm to like the client

Version 0.2 - 24 Sep 2003
	-- Serialization works
	-- Possible BUG: Only the lower byte of the characters of keys are sent
		This is only a problem if the memcache server can handle
		unicode keys. (I haven't checked)
	-- Server Failures handled gracefully
	-- Partial Javadoc

Version 0.1 - 23 Sep 2003
	-- Initial Release
	-- Storing and Retrieving numbers and strings works
