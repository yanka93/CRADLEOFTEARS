We're open. That's enough news for now. Stay tuned.

<?_c   <--- that's a comment.  you may want to uncomment this to 
            embed a journal you keep for news.  you'll need to 
            make a style, too.  OR... just enter news here in 
            HTML or BML, but that's kinda ghetto when you have a
            journal system already.  :)
