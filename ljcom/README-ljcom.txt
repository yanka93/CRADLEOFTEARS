The files in the "ljcom" CVS repository are not licensed under the GPL.

These are site-local modifications which differentiate LiveJournal.com
from other livejournal(the code)-based sites.  Everything here should
be pretty trivial and/or non-essential, but critical in making
LiveJournal "feel" different.

We provide the source to these files so developers/integrators know
the proper ways to extend LiveJournal.  (generally via hooks and extra
styles and *-local.* files)

While we encourage you to learn from these files, you do not have
permission to use them in production sites.  You may use them on
development servers such as goathack.livejournal.org.

Any questions or comments may be sent to:
