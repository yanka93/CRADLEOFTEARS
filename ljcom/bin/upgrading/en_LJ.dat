<dt>LiveJournal.com Subdomain</dt>

/paidaccounts/index.bml.whypay.argument<<
No, of course not. Paying for web services is annoying, we agree.

<p>This section of the site allows you to create, edit, and delete customized S1 styles. This

<p>You can also create <em>embedded</em> styles which, rather than
creating a full page, include only the Journal entries and leave
you to <a href="/developer/embedding.bml">embed your journal in another site</a>.</p>

<p>You can read more about the style system in the

The template must be used for all suggestions. Be sure to fill out all areas of the template, and make sure your suggestion is correct and complete before you post it. Also, the suggestion generator does not add in line breaks, so you can use the &lt;br&gt; tag to produce whitespace. This makes your suggestion easier to read.

/suggestions/index.bml.rules<<
There are a few things to keep in mind:
<ul>
<li>Many suggestions have already been proposed and discussed, but simply not implemented yet. Be sure that you're not submitting a duplicate.</li>
<li>Flaming will not be tolerated. Everyone has different ideas about how LiveJournal should work; remember that promoting your opinion is all right, but flaming someone else's opinion is not.</li>
<li>Be as thorough as possible with your suggestion. A suggestion that contains detailed implementation notes is more likely to be accepted than one that doesn't. You don't need to know how to program; just try to think about what else your idea would affect, and bring up any problems you can see with it.</li>
<li>Be sure to read the <a href="/support/faq.bml">FAQs</a> first, to see if your idea already exists, or if an existing aspect of the site can be used to do what you want.</li>
<li>If you want to ask a question about how LiveJournal works,  aren't certain if something exists or not, or are having a problem, don't submit a suggestion. Ask <a href="/support/">Support</a> instead.</li>

/support/encodings.bml.edit.text<<
<?p <b>Short answer:</b> <i>(applicable if you write your journal in English)</i>: Go to your 
<a href="/editinfo.bml">personal settings page</a>. Find an option
near the bottom of the page that is called <b>Auto-convert older entries from:</b>. Choose
"Western European (Windows)" from the pull-down menu and save your settings. Your entries should
now be editable. p?>

<?p <b>Long answer</b>: In order to allow you to edit a non-Unicode entry, LiveJournal code needs to 
know which encoding that entry has been posted in. For users of English and other West European 
languages, this will normally be "Western European (Windows)", although if that doesn't work well
for quote characters and other similar meta-characters, try "Western European (ISO)". Users
writing in other languages should select their encoding; if it isn't in the supplied list, 
contact <a href="/support/">Support</a> and explain the problem.  p?>

<?p Note that "non-Unicode entry" may mean either a journal entry posted before LiveJournal underwent
the conversion to Unicode, or a new journal entry posted recently with a client program that 
is not Unicode-compatible.  p?>
.

/support/encodings.bml.overview.text<<
<?p LiveJournal uses Unicode to store and display everything: 
text of journal entries, comments, names and personal information... everything. 
Unicode is a very powerful standard for working with text. 
For example, it allows users to store and input information in many languages at once. 
It supports the infrastructure of translating and maintaining the user interface in 
languages other than English. p?>

<?p Journal entries and comments which had been stored before LiveJournal switched
to Unicode need to be converted to Unicode on-the-fly in order for the user to be able 
to view or edit them. This page explains how to deal with some of the common problems in
that area. p?>
.

/support/help.bml.interim<<
<?p Every LiveJournal user is welcome to volunteer in 
Support. There are many resources that you may find helpful. 
The most important for new volunteers are listed here. p?>

<ul><li><a href="/doc/guide/support.bml">The Support Guide</a></li>
<li><?ljcomm lj_support ljcomm?></li> 
<li><?ljcomm helpscreening ljcomm?></li></ul>

<?p Both of the above communities have particularly helpful posts 
listed as memories. The <cite><a href="/tools/memories.bml?user=helpscreening&keyword=Getting+Started&filter=all">Getting 
Started</a></cite> category in <a href="/tools/memories.bml?user=helpscreening">HelpScreening's memories</a> 
is an especially good place for new 
volunteers to get information. p?>

<?p New volunteers should keep the following basic rules of  
Support in mind: p?>

<ul><li>Be professional and courteous.</li>
<li>Don't contact people submitting requests outside the Support 
board to discuss their request or give them information.</li>
<li>Keep information in Support requests private.</li>
<li>Don't copy other people's answers.</li></ul>

<?hr?>

<?p When you first start answering requests in Support, your 
answers will be screened. You won't be able to see other 
screened answers. Experienced Support volunteers will approve 
the first answer that fully answers the request and follows 
Support's guidelines. If your answer isn't approved, it either 
wasn't first or had some problem with it. You can learn why 
answers are or aren't approved by asking in <?ljcomm helpscreening ljcomm?>, but 
please wait until there is an approved answer in the request. p?>

<?p Points are awarded when a request is closed. They are given 
only to an approved answer. People who submit requests also 
have the option of closing without credit. Because of this, 
many requests will close with no points awarded. It generally 
takes about a week for a request to close, but this time can vary
based on the type of request. p?>

<?p Support points can be difficult to earn, but if you have patience 
and persistence, you can learn how to write approvable answers 
and both earn Support points and help people. p?>

<?p Support requests can be found on the <a 
href="/support/help.bml">Support 
board</a>. p?>

Congratulations, you have a new LiveJournal account!

To complete your journal creation and verify your e-mail address, go
here:

   [[regurl]]

The URL that your new journal is located at is:

   [[siteroot]]/users/[[username]]/

and also:

   [[siteroot]]/~[[username]]/

Below is your LiveJournal username and password:

   Username: [[username]]
   Password: [[password]]

You can go to [[siteroot]]/ to access your account, create
new journal entries, and modify your journal options, but we recommend 
downloading a LiveJournal client. It's the easiest way to update your 
journal, and there are clients available for many platforms! Get one at:

   [[siteroot]]/download/

Getting started on LiveJournal can be difficult when you don't know
anyone. Visit http://newbies.livejournal.com for smart, helpful advice...
with a little luck, you'll be a LiveJournal pro in no time!

We hope you appreciate LiveJournal as much as we appreciate bringing it to
you.  If you have any questions regarding how to use LiveJournal, please
visit the support area at:

   [[siteroot]]/support/ 

There you'll find answers to almost any question you could ask about 
LiveJournal.

Our goal is to make LiveJournal totally rock... if we can do anything to
make it easier, more powerful, more customizable, whatever... let us know.
We're not running the site to make money.  We're not a dot-com company
funded by venture-capital hoping to go IPO ... this site is run by all the
people that use it.  Let us know what you want out of it.

If you have questions, the support team will get you an answer usually
in less than 24 hours.

Enjoy!

[[sitename]] Team
