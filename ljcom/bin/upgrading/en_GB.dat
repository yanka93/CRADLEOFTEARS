<?h1 Welcome! h1?> 
<?p 
Welcome to the LiveJournal Community Centre. This is the place to find out how and where to interact with your fellow LiveJournal addicts! LiveJournal isn't only a a great place for keeping a journal, it's a place where people meet, interact, share common interests, and have a good time. Here are some of our community features to keep you informed and in touch. 
p?> 

<?h1 New? h1?> 
<?p 
Are you new to LiveJournal and don't know quite what to do yet? Then you'll want to head over to <a href="/community/newbies"><strong>The 'Newbies' Lounge</strong></a>, where you'll find answers to many of the questions you may have. Visit <?ljcomm newbies ljcomm?>, explore a bit, and you'll be a pro in no time at all! 
p?> 

<?h1 Stay informed! h1?> 
<?p 
Stay informed of what's going on in LiveJournal. There are a number of official LiveJournal communities you may wish to browse. The following two are particularly useful. 
<br /><br /> 
Add <?ljuser news ljuser?> to your friends page to keep up with events and issues that are relevant to the entire LiveJournal community.<br /> 
Add <?ljcomm lj_maintenance ljcomm?> to your friends page to be informed when downtime is planned, and reports on unplanned interruptions of service. 
p?> 

<?h1 Chat! h1?> 
<?p 
LiveJournal users chat up a storm. Many of them use popular instant messengers, including <a href="http://www.aim.com/index.adp"><strong>AIM</strong></a>, <a href="http://web.icq.com/"><strong>ICQ</strong></a>, <a href="http://messenger.yahoo.com/"><strong>Yahoo!</strong></a>, <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/"><strong>MSN</strong></a>, or <a href="http://www.jabber.org/"><strong>Jabber</strong></a> instant messengers. If you do, be sure to list it in your <a href="/editinfo.bml"><strong>personal info settings</strong></a>. If you have a <a href="/paidaccounts/"><strong>Paid Account</strong></a>, you can also enable your mobile phone or pager to <a href="/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=30"><strong>receive text messages</strong></a>. 
p?> 

<?h1 Volunteer! h1?> 
<?p 
Don't be shy! Help out! The best way to help out is by purchasing a <a href="/paidaccounts/"><strong>Paid Account</strong></a>. There are, of course, loads of other ways you help out. 
<br /><br /> 
LiveJournal is an Open Source project; if you have experience with programming languages or server side applications you can check out the <strong>LiveJournal Development Community</strong>, <?ljcomm lj_dev ljcomm?>. If you have ideas about how LiveJournal could be better, check out the <strong>LiveJournal Suggestions Area</strong>, <?ljcomm suggestions ljcomm?>. If you would like to help with just about anything, visit the <strong>LiveJournal Business Community</strong>, <?ljcomm lj_biz ljcomm?>. If you like helping people, visit our technical support centre and help someone out. If you are savy with graphic design, check out the <strong>LiveJournal Art Community</strong>, <?ljcomm lj_art ljcomm?>. 
p?> 

<?h1 What is a Community? h1?> 
<?p 
A community is basically a journal run by a member of LiveJournal for people with common interests. Communities are free to use and create... anyone can have them, and they're easy to set up, too! LiveJournal Communities cover topics from <a href="/community/anime/"><strong>Anime</strong></a> to <a href="/community/zen_within/"><strong>Zen Buddhism</strong></a>, from <a href="/community/astronomy/"><strong>Astronomy</strong></a> to <a href="/community/invader_zim/"><strong>Zim</strong></a>. You'll also find regional communities for places all around the world. There's probably a LiveJournal community for where you live too! 
p?> 

<?h1 How do I create my own Community? h1?> 
<?p 
There is a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=78"><strong>FAQ</strong></a> that will explain how to create your very own community. There are also two FAQ Categories (<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqcat=community"><strong>General Community FAQs</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqcat=comm-manage"><strong>Community Management FAQs</strong></a>) covering just about everything you'll ever need to know about communities. If you still need more information, feel free to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/submit.bml"><strong>submit a support request</strong></a>. 
p?> 

<?h1 How do I find other Communities? h1?> 
<?p 
At this time there are two official LiveJournal Communities specifically created to help you find the community you're looking for. 
p?> 

<ul> 
<li><strong><a href="./search.bml">Community Search</a></strong></li> 
<li><strong>Check out the Promotions Community (<?ljcomm community_promo ljcomm?>)</strong></li>

However, if you're the only user of your computer and nobody else has access to it, you may choose to remain logged in forever. For more information on this and other options, see <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=135">What are the options when I log in?</a>

/modify_do.bml.journaloptions.about<<
From here you can customise the look of your LiveJournal pages. If you're really curious how everything works, read the <a href="/developer/" target="_blank">developer information</a>. Otherwise, we'll assume you're satisifed with the basic options below:

.

/modify_do.bml.moodicons.about=When posting journal entries you can also specify your current mood.  Users have submitted different sets of mood icons that you can use, or you can select "None" if you don't want any pictures beside your moods. (of course, you don't even have to use the Current Mood feature at all.)

/modify_do.bml.overrides.about=If you are happy with the journal layout options above, you can ignore this section. This is for tweaking very specific things about your page layout. See <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=124">What are overrides? How do they work?</a> for an overview, and visit the <A HREF="/developer/" TARGET=_blank>developer section</A> for details. Also note that overrides are for overriding only one or two things about a style. If you'd like to override everything, you need to <A HREF="/styles/create.bml" TARGET=_blank>create your own style</A>. For an overview of how to create a style, see <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=128">How do I make a custom style?</a>

/modify_do.bml.overrides.note=Please note that not all style variables can be overridden. See the <a href="/developer/varlist.bml">documentation</a> for more details.<br />Also, be aware that if you attempt to edit your overrides and you have used a tag that is not allowed in the head of the document -- such as &lt;DIV&gt;, &lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;IMG&gt;, and many other tags -- that tag will be stripped. The only HTML elements that can be used in the *_HEAD overrides are those elements that are valid in the head of a HTML document. This is limited to &lt;title&gt;, &lt;base&gt;, &lt;style&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, and &lt;meta&gt;.

/modify_do.bml.overrides.warning=THIS IS <U>NOT</U> WHERE YOU TYPE YOUR JOURNALâ€¼

/paidaccounts/index.bml.costs.rates.inexpensive<<
That works out to a little over <b>$2/month</b> (roughly Â£1.30) for the year plan.
That'll hardly break the bank.
The most annoying part will likely be pulling out your wallet, finding your credit card, and typing in your information.

/suggestions/index.bml.rules<<
There are a few things to keep in mind: 
<ul> 
<li>Many suggestions have already been proposed and discussed, but simply not implemented yet. Be sure that you're not submitting a duplicate.</li> 
<li>Flaming will not be tolerated. Everyone has different ideas about how LiveJournal should work; remember that promoting your opinion is all right, but flaming someone else's opinion is not.</li> 
<li>Be as thorough as possible with your suggestion. A suggestion that contains detailed implementation notes is more likely to be accepted than one that doesn't. You don't need to know how to program; just try to think about what else your idea would affect, and bring up any problems you can see with it.</li> 
<li>Be sure to read the <a href="/support/faq.bml">FAQs</a> first, to see if your idea already exists, or if an existing aspect of the site can be used to do what you want.</li> 
<li>If you want to ask a question about how LiveJournal works, aren't certain if something exists or not, or are having a problem, don't submit a suggestion. Ask <a href="/support/">Support</a> instead.</li> 
</ul>

<?p Every LiveJournal user is welcome to volunteer in 
Support. There are many resources that you may find helpful. 
The most important for new volunteers are listed here. p?> 

<ul><li><a href="/doc/guide/support.bml">The Support Guide</a></li> 
<li><?ljcomm lj_support ljcomm?></li> 
<li><?ljcomm helpscreening ljcomm?></li></ul> 

<?p Both of the above communities have particularly helpful posts 
listed as memories. The <cite><a href="/tools/memories.bml?user=helpscreening&keyword=Getting+Started&filter=all">Getting 
Started</a></cite> category in <a href="/tools/memories.bml?user=helpscreening">HelpScreening's memories</a> 
is an especially good place for new 
volunteers to get information. p?> 

<?p New volunteers should keep the following basic rules of 
Support in mind: p?> 

<ul><li>Be professional and courteous.</li> 
<li>Don't contact people submitting requests outside the Support 
board to discuss their request or give them information.</li> 
<li>Keep information in Support requests private.</li> 
<li>Don't copy other people's answers.</li></ul> 

<?hr?> 

<?p When you first start answering requests in Support, your 
answers will be screened. You won't be able to see other 
screened answers. Experienced Support volunteers will approve 
the first answer that fully answers the request and follows 
Support's guidelines. If your answer isn't approved, it either 
wasn't first or had some problem with it. You can learn why 
answers are or aren't approved by asking in <?ljcomm helpscreening ljcomm?>, but 
please wait until there is an approved answer in the request. p?> 

<?p Points are awarded when a request is closed. They are given 
only to an approved answer. People who submit requests also 
have the option of closing without credit. Because of this, 
many requests will close with no points awarded. It generally 
takes about a week for a request to close, but this time can vary 
based on the type of request. p?> 

<?p Support points can be difficult to earn, but if you have patience 
and persistence, you can learn how to write approvable answers 
and both earn Support points and help people. p?> 

<?p Support requests can be found on the <a 
href="/support/help.bml">Support 
board</a>. p?>
