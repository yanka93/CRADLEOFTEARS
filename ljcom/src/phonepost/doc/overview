steps that happen when a phone call comes in
--------------------------------------------

 - Phone call goes to the VoicePulse number.
   
 - They do some magic and pass the communication via IAX (Inter-AsteriSK
   protocol) to our Asterisk.
   
 - iax.conf specifies that the VoicePulse IAX goes to the "livejournal"
   extension.
   
 - extensions.conf specifies that the "livejournal" extension answers the
   phone, waits a second, and then runs the AGI (Asterisk Gateway
   Interface) script called "livejournal".
   
 - The livejournal script lives in agi-bin/.  It does these steps:

    - First, it runs through the appropriate menus and eventually spits
      out a wav file in
      PHONESPOOL/in/$userid-$currentunixtime.wav.
      (PHONESPOOL is hard-coded into the livejournal script; it
       probably ought to be on whichever machine does the mp3 encoding.)

    - Next, it runs the MP3 encoder, which encodes the file
      into PHONESPOOL/out/$userid-$currentunixtime.mp3, and
      deletes the wav file out of the in/ directory.

    - Then we pass that file to the blob server to store, and finally
      post to LJ with the blobid.

 - When the interface script returns, we hang up.
