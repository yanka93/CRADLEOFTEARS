<?h1 What is a Community? h1?>
<?p
A community is basically a journal run by a member of LiveJournal for people with common interests. Communities are free to use and create... anyone can have them, and they're easy to set up, too! LiveJournal Communities cover topics from <a href="/community/anime/"><strong>Anime</strong></a> to <a href="/community/zen_within/"><strong>Zen Buddhism</strong></a>, from <a href="/community/astronomy/"><strong>Astronomy</strong></a> to <a href="/community/invader_zim/"><strong>Zim</strong></a>.  You'll also find regional communities for places all around the world. There's probably a LiveJournal community for where you live too!

<?h1 How do I create my own Community? h1?>
<?p
There is a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=78"><strong>FAQ</strong></a> that will explain how to create your very own community.  There are also two FAQ Categories (<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqcat=community"><strong>General Community FAQs</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqcat=comm-manage"><strong>Community Management FAQs</strong></a>) covering just about everything you'll ever need to know about communities.  If you still need more information, feel free to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/submit.bml"><strong>submit a support request</strong></a>.
p?>

<?h1 How do I find other Communities? h1?>
<?p
You can search <a href="/interests.bml"><strong>by interest</strong></a>! If the interest you search under is listed by 1000 or more users, the results returned to you will be limited, so try to define your search. The more specific you can be when searching, the more chance you have of finding just the right community for you!
<br /><br />
There are two official LiveJournal Communities specifically created to help you find the community you're looking for. 

<ul>
<li><strong>Check out the Promotions Community (<?ljcomm community_promo ljcomm?>)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Check out the Search Community (<?ljcomm community_quest ljcomm?>)</strong></li>
</ul>
