<?h1 What? h1?>
<?p
A lot of words in the English language (and possibly other languages) sound
the same but have different spellings and/or different meanings. The problem is that a lot of people never learn these different spellings and meanings and just
go about their merry way using the wrong words. When somebody is
speaking, you can't tell. However, once you start writing stuff, like web
pages or email, you make the big mistake of confusing your readers.  
People that don't already know what the right homonym is will learn it
wrong, from your usage. Those that know the right word will just think
you're a moron. So what should you do? <strong>Learn it right!</strong>

<?h1 There, Their, and They're h1?>
<?h2 There h2?>
<?p <strong>There</strong> is usually used to describe a physical place or location, or at least a noun. It can also be used in other ways, but I don't know how to best describe it. The following examples should help:
p?>
<ul>
<li>Over <B>there</B> is my brain!  I left it on the side of the road.</li>
<li><B>There</B> exists a time when every man must learn his homonyms.</li>
<li>Do you see now that <B>there</B> is a difference?</li>
</UL>

<?H2 Their H2?>
<?P <B>Their</B> is used to show possesion.  Just as 'his' shows possesion
of an object by 'him', and 'her' shows possesion of 'her', <B>their</B> shows
possesion of an object by a group, <B>they</B>.
P?>
<UL>
<LI>It's <B>their</B> crap, not yours.
<LI><B>Their</B> idea to teach people homonyms was wonderful.
</UL>

<?H2 They're H2?>
<?P <B>They're</B> is a contraction of the words "they" and "are", as indicated
by its apostrophe.  You use it to describe a group of objects or whatnot.  If
your sentence doesn't sound right by replacing <B>they're</B> with <B>they are</B>, 
then you're using the wrong form of there/their/they're.
P?>
<UL>
<LI><B>They're</B> stupid; they don't even know their homonyms.
<LI>It's good that <B>they're</B> reading this page though.
</UL>
