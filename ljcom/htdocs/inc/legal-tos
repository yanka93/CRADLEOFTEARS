<li><strong>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</strong>

<p>Danga Interactive, Inc., dba LiveJournal.com, (.LiveJournal.com.)
provides the following service to you, subject to these Terms of Service
("TOS"), which may be updated periodically without notice.</p>

<p>You can review the current version of the TOS at: <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/legal/tos.bml">http://www.livejournal.com/legal/tos.bml</a>.
Failure to comply with these TOS may result in account revocation.</p>

</li>

<li><strong>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</strong>

<p>LiveJournal.com is a web-based service that allows its users to create
and update online journals (herein referred to as "LiveJournal", or
"the Service"). The Service may be used through a web browser or by
the use of downloadable clients ("the Software"). Once registered with
LiveJournal.com, each user receives his or her own journal space to post
text, data, messages, or information concerning or linked to software,
music, sound, photography, graphics, and video ("the Content"). This
Content may reside on LiveJournal's servers or on the servers of a third
party.</p>

</li>

<li><strong>ACCOUNT STRUCTURE</strong>

<p>LiveJournal currently has a four-tier account structure.</p>

<ul>

<li><em>Free Accounts:</em> LiveJournal.com accounts are available for free
to all valid registrants. Free accounts offer a limited number of features
in relation to the other accounts offered.

<li><em>Early Adopter:</em> No longer open to new users, this account
was created and made available to users registered before September 14,
2000. Early Adopters are offered extended features over free account users,
but do not receive any new pay features.</li>

<li><em>Paid Accounts:</em> Paid accounts are available
for term-based fee and offer users all extended and basic
features that LiveJournal.com offers. These accounts
are issued in accordance with the terms set forth by <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/paidaccounts/">http://www.livejournal.com/paidaccounts/</a>.
Paid accounts are nontransferable and
non-refundable. Once a username is chosen and paid for, that user generally
retains it until the journal is deleted, whether by LiveJournal.com or the
user.</li>

<li><em>Permanent Accounts:</em> These accounts have access to all
the paid account features for as long as the Service continues to
run, with no recurring fees.  These accounts are generally bestowed
upon the LiveJournal.com founders, administrators, or those that
have earned a Permanent Account by virtue of "Work Excellence" for
LiveJournal.com. LiveJournal administrative communities such as news,
development, et al. are also established as Permanent Accounts for the
benefit of LiveJournal users.</li>

</ul>

<p>For a full overview of the features offered to each account type,
see <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/paidaccounts/">http://www.livejournal.com/paidaccounts/</a>. You hereby agree to this
structure, and to LiveJournal.com's right to change, modify, or discontinue

<li>All Content posted to LiveJournal.com in any way, is the responsibility
and property of the author. LiveJournal is committed to keeping the
Service in decent standing for all audiences but is not responsible for
the monitoring or filtering of any journal Content. Within the confines
of international and local law, LiveJournal.com will generally not
place a limit on the type, or appropriateness of user content within
journals. Those users posting material not suitable for all audiences
must agree that they are fully responsible for all the content they have
posted anywhere on the service. Should content be deemed illegal by such
law having jurisdiction over the user, LiveJournal.com is committed to
submitting all necessary information to the proper authorities;</li>

<li>Should any Content be reported to LiveJournal.com as being offensive
or inappropriate, LiveJournal.com might call upon the poster to retract,
modify, or protect (by means of private and friends only settings) the
Content in question within a reasonable amount of time, as set forth by the
LiveJournal.com staff. Should the poster fail to meet such a request from
LiveJournal.com staff, LiveJournal.com has the full authority to terminate
any such reported and verified account holding such inappropriate content.
LiveJournal.com, however, is under no obligation to restrict or monitor
journal Content in any way;</li>

<li>LiveJournal.com claims no ownership or control over any Content
posted by its users. The author retains all patent, trademark, and
copyright to all Content posted within available fields, and is responsible
for protecting those rights, but is not entitled to the help of the
LiveJournal.com staff in protecting such Content. The user posting any
Content represents that the poster has all rights necessary to post such
Content (and for LiveJournal to serve such Content) without violation of
any intellectual property or other rights or any laws or regulations;</li>

<li>LiveJournal.com reserves the right, without limitation except by law,
to serve any user Content on the web, through the downloadable clients and
otherwise.  LiveJournal.com also reserves the right, without limitation, to
resell any portion of a user's LiveJournal back to that individual;</li>

<li>You acknowledge that LiveJournal.com does not pre-screen Content, but
that LiveJournal.com and its designates shall have the right (but not
the obligation) on their sole discretion to refuse or remove any Content
that is available through the Service. Without limiting the foregoing,
LiveJournal.com and its designates shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to remove any content that violates the TOS or is otherwise

property rights. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks
associated with, the use of any content, including any reliance on the
accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such content.  Furthermore,
LiveJournal.com reserves the right to limit access to your journal, if

<li><strong>VOLUNTEERS AND LIVEJOURNAL.COM</strong>

<p>LiveJournal.com appreciates the significant contributions made by
volunteers, who assist LiveJournal.com in its efforts to provide high
quality, community driven online services. To help achieve this goal,
LiveJournal.com volunteers perform a variety of technical and non-technical
tasks, including, but not limited to, programming, the creation of
web-based content (HTML, BML, and other formats), graphic design, audio
and/or visual content creation, technical writing, managing electronic data
libraries and/or databases, technical support, reviewing, categorizing,
legal assistance, archiving and/or forwarding electronic data, providing
expert advice, administration, management, accounting, research, content
creation, promotions, or other assignments, as needed. All volunteers are
expected to be of legal age, or volunteering with the consent of a legal
parent or guardian.</p>

<p>By accepting these Terms of Service, any LiveJournal.com member agrees
that the intellectual content created as a result of volunteer work for
LiveJournal.com constitutes intellectual property of LiveJournal.com and
that all rights in said content shall vest in LiveJournal.com at the
time that it is created, to the extent permitted by law. If laws prevent
such vesting, the volunteer makes assignment of all such rights to
LiveJournal.com at the time of creation. If laws prevent such assignment,
the volunteer grants a perpetual world wide irrevocable license to
LiveJournal.com to use said content. If laws prevent such licensing,
the volunteer agrees never to sue LiveJournal.com for the use of said
content.</p>

<p>The volunteer certifies that any electronic data he/she submits is
his/her work and that to the best of the volunteer's knowledge, the
electronic data is not claimed by another. The volunteer agrees to insure
that any work provided is correct, error free and does not contain any
inflammatory language, indecency or obscenities.  Furthermore, if said work
is found to be illegally presented, claimed, or forged, LiveJournal.com
may remove such material and, at LiveJournal.com's discretion, seek
action against the individual(s) from which the work originated.  No
LiveJournal user is required to become a volunteer to this service,
and users without volunteer status will receive reasonable support and
attention as well.  Without the expressed written confirmation to the
contrary, all LiveJournal.com positions are assumed to be taken without pay
or future consideration.</p>
