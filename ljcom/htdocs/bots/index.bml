<?p You are encouraged to use these resources instead of "screen-scraping" user pages. p?>
<?h1 Rates &amp; Limits h1?>
<?p You are encouraged to cache the results of your bot's requests, which saves us bandwidth and CPU time. Bots making repeated requests on the same resource (URL) in a short amount of time will be blocked. Please do not multithread your bot to access multiple resources at the same time. p?>
<?h1 Well-Formed User Agents h1?>
<?p All bots are required to have a well-formed user agent which includes a contact email address for the bot maintainer, 
and preferrably a URL to the organization running the bot. Bots without this information have a higher chance of being blocked. An example of a well-formed user agent is: p?><blockquote><tt>http://example.com/ljtoy.html; bob@example.com</tt></blockquote>
<?h1 Contact Information h1?>
<?p If you need specific information for research or data-collection purposes, feel free to contact us at <tt>webmaster@livejournal.com</tt>. If we've blocked your bot and you'd like to contact us about it, please email us at <tt>webmaster@livejournal.com</tt>. p?>
